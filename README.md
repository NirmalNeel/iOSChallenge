# iOSChallenge

This is the iOS Challege that was given by Vog App Developers
To complete this task I used Xcode Version 8.2.1 (8C1002)

The main app works as follows:

1. Using the tools you know best for iOS, create an application that initially displays
a form with controls to enter a username and password and submit the form.
2. When the form is submitted ensure: The username is at least 8 characters in
length and alphabetic The password is at least 8 characters in length
3. Then navigate to another page and display an image and a button to return to the
previous screen. When tapped, the image should show a message saying “Hello
username ” where username is the one entered on the previous screen.
4. If the user returns to the previous screen all information in the form should be
cleared.
